Implemented a Malware Detection and Classification system by integrating Cuckoo Sandbox for dynamic file analysis. This system submits files to Cuckoo Sandbox, extracting behavioural patterns, and utilises a feature-rich machine learning model to classify files into distinct malware families. Also created a custom dataset from the detailed JSON reports generated during the analysis process and employed different machine learning algorithms for accurate detection and classification.
